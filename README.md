# P110.co.uk Website
A full-stack NodeJS MVC application with custom CMS and Youtube API integration. 

Designed to sit behind an Nginx proxy which handles SSL and static files.

## Tech overview

#### Express
The core web server, route handler and backbone of the application.

#### MongoDB
Stores accounts and simple CMS data for news articles, video posts and artists. Simple relational queries are used to attach artists to posts.

#### Passport
Handles login sessions and secure password hashing.

#### Stylus
CSS preprocessor of choice, used with PostCSS for browser prefixing and minifying. Critical above-the-fold CSS is separated and inlined for faster page rendering.

#### Pug
HTML templating language of choice for rendering views and emails.

#### Gulp
Handles CSS and JS preprocessing. Uses a BrowserSync proxy to inject CSS changes, sync across devices and reload pages automatically.

#### Youtube Scraper
Custom-built on top of the Youtube API to track pageviews across all videos on a regular basis. Used to generate lists of top videos, aggregate scores across artists and show view counts.

#### Automatic backups
The database is backed up to S3 every night, limited the most recent 30 backups. Backup limits and frequency are configurable.

#### Sitemap
The sitemap is generated by crawling the site when the server loads and is refreshed nightly (configurable) via cron. The XML file is placed into the public folder to be served statically.


## Getting Started

#### Environment variables
Create two files called `variables.env` and `variables.aws.json` in the root folder and enter the correct database/AWS information (see relevant `.example.env` files). Make sure to use a secure session key and secret.

Set `NODE_ENV` to `development` or `production`. Production mode is much faster and caches Pug templates in memory, but isn't suitable for front-end development because the server must be restarted to load changes.

#### Starting the server
Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

You'll need two terminal sessions for development, tmux with two panes is ideal.

Run `npm start` in the first session to start the Express server and `gulp` in the second session to start the front-end Gulp/BrowserSync scripts.

#### Deployment
Clone the repo and ensure NodeJS, MongoDB and npm dependencies are installed and securely configured on the web server. Use `helpers/mongo-backup.js` and `helpers/mongo-restore.js` to sync the database from local to production if needed.

Create `variables.env` and `variables.aws.json` as these aren't checked into version control. Use `NODE_ENV=production`.

Test the server with `nodemon start.js` and check for runtime errors.

Run `start.js` as a background process using a Node daemon like Forever or PM2. This will keep the app permanently running on port 8888.

Set up Nginx or equivalent web server to listen on port 80/443. Configure it to handle SSL certificates and serve requests for static content directly, as it's more efficient than Express. Proxy any remaining requests to the app on port 8888.
